## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**❌ "Connection failed: Database connection failed"**
- Verify your Supabase URL format: `https://your-project.supabase.co`
- Ensure you're using the **anon/public** key, not service_role
- Check that your Supabase project is active (not paused)

**❌ "Missing required environment variables"**
- This error is normal for self-hosted setups
- Configure your credentials in the Settings UI

**❌ "relation 'credentials' does not exist"**
- The database setup script hasn't been run
- Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run the complete setup script

### Dashboard Issues

**❌ Dashboard shows "No credentials found" after setup**
- Click the **"Refresh App"** button
- Clear browser cache and reload
- For PWA: Uninstall and reinstall the app

**❌ Can't add credentials**
- Verify RLS policies are enabled
- Check that you're authenticated (should happen automatically)
- Ensure the setup script completed without errors

**❌ Can't enter new credentials after clearing configuration**
- Refresh the page after clearing configuration
- Ensure you're typing the correct URL format: `https://your-project.supabase.co`
- Try clearing browser cache if form inputs appear stuck
- The form should accept empty fields after clearing - if not, refresh the page

**❌ Categories dropdown is empty when using custom username**
- This issue has been resolved in the latest version
- Default categories should now appear for all usernames (both default and custom)
- Custom categories remain isolated to their respective users
- If still experiencing issues, try refreshing the page after setting your username

### Performance Issues

**❌ Slow loading**
- Check your internet connection to Supabase
- Consider choosing a Supabase region closer to you
- Clear browser cache

**❌ PWA not working offline**
- Ensure you've used the app online first
- Check that service worker is registered
- Try reinstalling the PWA

### Getting Help

1. **Check the SQL Script**: Ensure it ran without errors
2. **Verify Credentials**: Double-check your Supabase URL and key
3. **Browser Console**: Check for error messages (F12 → Console)
4. **Supabase Logs**: Check your Supabase project logs
5. **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs at [github.com/pinkpixel-dev/keyper](https://github.com/pinkpixel-dev/keyper)

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Database Security
- ✅ **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled by default
- ✅ **User isolation** - each user only sees their own data
- ✅ **Encrypted connections** - all data encrypted in transit
- ✅ **Supabase encryption** - data encrypted at rest

### Best Practices
1. **Use strong Supabase passwords**
2. **Keep your anon key secure** (don't share publicly)
3. **Regular backups** of your Supabase database
4. **Monitor access logs** in Supabase dashboard
5. **Update Keyper regularly** for security patches

### What Pink Pixel Can't See
- ❌ Your stored credentials
- ❌ Your Supabase data
- ❌ Your database credentials
- ❌ Your usage patterns

### What's Stored Where
- **Your Credentials**: Your Supabase database (encrypted)
- **App Configuration**: Browser localStorage
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (secure)

### Updating Keyper
```bash
# Update to latest version

### Database Maintenance
- **Backups**: Use Supabase's backup features
- **Monitoring**: Check Supabase dashboard regularly
- **Scaling**: Upgrade Supabase plan if needed

### Supabase Free Tier Limits
